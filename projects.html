                <h3>Metaverse & Exposure of Children to the Dark Corners of the Internet</h3>
                <p>Currently Researching</p>
                <p>The metaverse, an expanding network of persistent, immersive virtual worlds, presents novel challenges for child safety. While platforms such as VRChat offer unprecedented social interaction, their open and often unmoderated nature creates significant risks. These environments can expose minors to harmful content, grooming, and simulated sexual assault, mirroring the dangers of the internet's most unregulated spaces. This research investigates the specific vulnerabilities inherent in such platforms, analyses the mechanisms through which harm occurs, and evaluates potential technological and policy-based safeguards to protect children in these nascent digital territories.</p>

                <h3>Feast on the Desperate</h3>
                <p>Release Date: <time>15/08/2025</time></p>
                <p><strong>The Challenge:</strong> This paper addresses the escalating threat of cryptocurrency scams by
                    examining the social engineering and psychological tactics that exploit individuals. We identify a
                    critical gap in public awareness and expose how social media, leveraging platforms, influencers, and
                    targeted advertising, is a primary vector for these sophisticated schemes. The research highlights
                    that these scams succeed not just through technical means, but by preying on human vulnerabilities
                    like FoMo (Fear of Missing Out) and other emotional manipulations.</p>
                <p><strong>Methodology & Analysis:</strong> Through a detailed analysis of scam victimisation and
                    real-world testimonies, this work delves into the psychological underpinnings of why individuals
                    fall prey to these schemes. The paper synthesises elements from disparate fields, phishing
                    prevention, the SCAMS Checklist, the I-PACE model, and insights from parasocial relationships to
                    develop a new, comprehensive framework for scam prevention. This interdisciplinary approach provides
                    a more holistic defence strategy.</p>
                <p><strong>The Key Findings & Contributions:</strong>The study's findings confirm that scammers
                    systematically exploit financial fears and parasocial trust to bypass logical decision making. Our
                    primary contribution is the proposed comprehensive framework, which empowers individuals with a
                    combined set of tools to identify and avoid fraudulent cryptocurrency schemes. This framework's
                    novelty lies in its integration of psychological and social factors with established technical
                    prevention methods.</p>
                <p><strong>Implications & Conclusion:</strong> The implications of this research are significant for
                    both individuals and organisations. By understanding the psychological tactics employed by scammers,
                    we can better equip ourselves to resist these manipulative strategies. The proposed framework serves
                    as a valuable resource for developing targeted educational initiatives and preventive measures in
                    the fight against cryptocurrency scams.</p>
